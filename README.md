motion tracking and video editing.

Bforartists is a fork of the popular 3D software Blender, with the goal to improve the graphical UI, and to increase the usability.

The project page, the binary downloads and further information can be found at the project page: https://www.bforartists.de/
The main Differences between Bforartists and Blender are:

- An own keymap, which is reduced to just the necessary hotkeys and a navigation that can be purely done by mouse.
- Cleaned up User Interface. Lots of not necessary double, triple or even more equal menu entries removed.
- Extended User Interface. Lots of formerly hotkey only tools have a menu entry now.
- Rearranged User Interface. Some things are better accessible now, some are not so much in the way anymore.
- Improved defaults.
- Colored and as double as much icons than Blender.
- Configurable UI Elements like the Toolbar, with icon buttons.
- Tabs in the toolshelf.
- Improved Layouts.
- Left aligned checkboxes and text where possible.
- Better Tooltips.
- Better readable standard theme.
- Some neat addons to improve usability, like the reset 3D View addon or the Set Dimensions addon with which you can scale in world coordinates in edit mode.
- And lots more small details like not so much confirm dialogs. Or that we have resurrected the tabs in the tool shelf to allow quicker access to the tools.
